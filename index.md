Hi! This site is designed as a companion to [Griffith Library's](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library) Lime Survey workshop, presented in collaboration with Griffith [RED](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/researcher-education-development).

It can also be treated as a standalone, self-paced tutorial.

LimeSurvey is a fast, free, flexible and secure survey application that is available to you to assist with your research. This workshop is designed to be taken as a series of online videos and exercises, followed by a Q&A workshop. The PowerPoint slides can be found below. {% endcapture %}
